## Project: CG2StocksTracker

CG2StocksTracker is a desktop command-line portfolio tracker built for typing-oriented users who want to manage holdings quickly.
The user interacts with it through a CLI, and it is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Features: Implemented and refined parsing for `/set`, `/value`, and `/list`

- What:
    - `/set` supports updating price by `--type + --ticker` or by ticker-only update.
    - `/value` shows valuation for the active portfolio.
    - `/list` supports default listing, type filters (`--stock`, `--etf`, `--bond`), and portfolio summaries (`--portfolios`).
- Why:
    - These are core user workflows for daily usage (update prices, inspect holdings, check value).
    - Strong parser validation prevents invalid command states from propagating to execution logic.
- How:
    - Implemented validation paths and usage enforcement in `Parser`.
    - Coordinated parser behavior with execution-layer expectations to keep command contracts stable.

### Enhancement: Refactored parser and tests after command-signature changes

- What:
    - Refactored parser-related logic and updated tests when command signatures evolved during development.
- Why:
    - Reduced integration breakages and preserved behavior consistency across parser, model, and UI layers.
- How:
    - Updated parser test cases to cover both valid and invalid flows after each signature update.
    - Maintained regression safety while new behavior was introduced. [#24](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-W09-4/tp/pull/24)

### Documentation

- User Guide:
    - Updated most UG sections to match finalized command formats and examples.
    - Revised command usage wording for clarity after signature updates.
- Developer Guide:
    - Updated most DG sections to stay in sync with current implementation.
    - Added/updated UML diagrams for `/set`, `/value`, and `/list`.

### Contributions to team-based tasks

- Helped prepare and release `v1.0`.
- Supported team integration by keeping parser, tests, and documentation aligned during refactoring-heavy phases.
- Took initiative for grouping and delegating tasks, often leading discussions and keeping the team on track for deadlines

### Review and mentoring contributions

- Reviewed teammates' pull requests and gave feedback on parser behavior and command consistency.
- Helped teammates troubleshoot command-related refactoring and test failures.

### Contributions beyond the project team

- Shared implementation/refactoring insights with peers where relevant.
